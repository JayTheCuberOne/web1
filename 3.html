  2x2 is the smallest puzzle in cubing. It is also one of the easiest, too. It
has over 3 million combinations! Isn't it quite interesting? One of the best
solvers in the world solved it less than a second. It is really unbelieveable!</p>
    <p style="margin-top:45px;"><h1>2. 3x3</h1>
3x3 is the most classic puzzle in cubing. It
is most well-known Rubik's Cube. It has over 43 quintillion combinations and it
might be hard to solve it for some of you. Most begginers start with this puzzle
and solve it in a minute. The world record of this puzzle is 3 seconds.</p>
    <p style="margin-top:45px;"><h1>3. 4x4</h1>
  4x4 is a bigger puzzle than 3x3. It is also
little bit more complicated to solve. You need to make centers, edges, and fix
parities like OLL Parity and PLL Parity. It has more and more cominations than
rest of these puzzles.</p></span>
